# Card Animation System

This system provides smooth, animated card drawing instead of relying on Layout Groups. Cards animate from a deck position into the hand with smooth transitions, spacing, and visual effects.

## Components

### 1. CardAnimationManager
The main component that handles card positioning and animations.

**Key Features:**
- Smooth card drawing animations from deck to hand
- Automatic hand layout with proper spacing and arc
- Support for batch card drawing with staggered timing
- Card highlighting/hover effects
- Handles overlapping when hand is full

**Settings:**
- `handWidth`: Total width available for the hand
- `cardSpacing`: Base spacing between cards
- `maxCardOverlap`: Minimum spacing when hand is crowded
- `cardArcHeight`: How much cards arc upward in the center
- `drawAnimationDuration`: Time for draw animations
- `staggerDelay`: Delay between multiple card draws

### 2. CardAnimationSetup
A helper component to automatically configure the animation system.

**Usage:**
1. Add this component to any GameObject in your scene
2. Assign references or let it auto-find them
3. Right-click the component and select "Setup Card Animation System"
4. Or enable `autoSetupOnAwake` for automatic setup

### 3. CardHoverEffect
Optional component that adds hover animations to cards.

**Features:**
- Cards scale up and lift when hovered
- Smooth animations in/out
- Integrates with CardAnimationManager
- Fallback animations if no manager is available

## Setup Instructions

### Option 1: Automatic Setup
1. Add the `CardAnimationSetup` component to any GameObject
2. Right-click it and select "Setup Card Animation System"
3. This will automatically:
   - Create a CardAnimationManager
   - Set up deck position
   - Disable layout groups
   - Configure references

### Option 2: Manual Setup
1. **Create Animation Manager:**
   - Create an empty GameObject
   - Add the `CardAnimationManager` component
   - Assign `cardHandParent` (your UI panel containing cards)
   - Optionally create and assign a `deckPosition` transform

2. **Disable Layout Groups:**
   - On your card hand panel, disable any Layout Group components (Horizontal, Vertical, Grid, etc.)
   - The animation manager will handle positioning instead

3. **Configure CardManager:**
   - The CardManager will automatically find and use the CardAnimationManager
   - No additional setup required

4. **Add Hover Effects (Optional):**
   - Add `CardHoverEffect` component to your card prefab
   - Adjust hover settings as desired

## Key Differences from Layout Groups

### Before (Layout Groups):
- Cards positioned automatically by Unity UI
- No animation when cards are added/removed
- Limited control over spacing and arrangement
- Cards appear instantly

### After (Animation System):
- Cards animate smoothly from deck to hand
- Manual positioning with custom layout logic
- Full control over spacing, arcing, and effects
- Staggered animations for multiple cards
- Hover effects and highlighting

## Integration with Existing Code

The system integrates seamlessly with your existing CardManager:

```csharp
// CardManager automatically uses the animation system
cardManager.RefillHandToMaxSize(5); // Cards will animate into hand

// Clear hand with animation cleanup
cardManager.ClearHand(); // Stops animations and clears cards

// Individual card creation
cardManager.CreateCard(cardData); // Will animate if manager is available
```

## Animation Settings Explained

### Hand Layout:
- **handWidth**: Total horizontal space for cards (800px default)
- **cardSpacing**: Ideal space between cards (120px default)
- **maxCardOverlap**: Minimum spacing when crowded (50px default)
- **cardArcHeight**: Vertical arc effect (20px default)

### Timing:
- **drawAnimationDuration**: Time for each card draw (0.6s default)
- **repositionDuration**: Time to reposition existing cards (0.3s default)
- **staggerDelay**: Delay between multiple cards (0.1s default)

### Effects:
- **drawRotationAmount**: Random rotation during draw (15Â° default)
- **drawScaleEffect**: Scale overshoot during animation (1.2x default)

## Troubleshooting

### Cards not animating:
- Check that CardAnimationManager is in the scene
- Verify cardHandParent is assigned
- Make sure Layout Groups are disabled

### Cards positioned incorrectly:
- Adjust handWidth and cardSpacing settings
- Check that cardHandParent anchor is set correctly
- Verify RectTransform setup on card prefab

### Performance issues:
- Reduce staggerDelay for faster batch drawing
- Lower drawAnimationDuration for quicker animations
- Ensure only one CardAnimationManager exists in scene

## Customization

### Custom Easing:
The system includes several easing functions:
- EaseOutQuart: Smooth deceleration
- EaseInOutQuad: Smooth acceleration/deceleration
- EaseOutQuad/EaseInQuad: For hover effects

### Adding New Effects:
You can extend the CardAnimationManager to add:
- Card shake effects
- Particle effects on draw
- Sound integration
- Custom card trajectories

### Layout Modifications:
Modify `CalculateCardPosition()` and `CalculateCardRotation()` methods to change:
- Card arrangement patterns
- Fan-out effects
- Different hand shapes
- Dynamic layouts based on card count

## Example Usage

```csharp
// Get reference to animation manager
var animManager = FindObjectOfType<CardAnimationManager>();

// Draw a single card with animation
animManager.DrawCard(cardGameObject, true);

// Draw multiple cards with staggered animation
animManager.DrawMultipleCards(listOfCardGameObjects);

// Highlight a card (for hover effects)
animManager.HighlightCard(cardGameObject, true);

// Remove a card and reposition others
animManager.RemoveCard(cardGameObject, true);

// Clear all cards
animManager.ClearHand();
```

This system provides a much more engaging and professional feel to your card game compared to static layout groups!
